# OCB Electricity Solar Recipes Mod - 7 Days to Die Addon

This (XML-Only) Modlets adds two recipes to make solar panels
craftable within the workbench and cells craftable in the
chemstation. Both items are locked behind the Electrician
magazine tree. Solar panels unlock at level 100 alongside
battery banks, while solar cells can be crafted after
level 65 and quality scales the same as lead batteries.
Level 6 solar cells can still only be bought at traders.

## Materials

To craft solar cells you will need broken glass, as there is no
other glass material beside the bullet-proof glass block. Since it
felt a bit "wrong" to use the bullet-proof glass block I've added
another recipe to create broken glass inside the forge. Additionally
you will need one acid bottle to make for more scarcity. The solar
panel itself is crafted with regular materials (e.g. forged steel
etc.) and steel- and robotics tools in order to increase scarcity.
