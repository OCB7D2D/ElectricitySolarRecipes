# OCB Electricity Solar Recipes Mod - 7 Days to Die Addon

This (XML-Only) Modlets adds two recipes to make solar panels
and cells craftable within the workbench. Both items are locked
behind the advanced engineering perk. For solar panels you'll
need level four, while solar cells can be crafted after level 2.
Quality will be depending on your perk level. Level 6 solar cells
can still only be bought at traders.

## Materials

To craft solar cells you will need broken glass, as there is no
other glass material beside the bullet-proof glass block. Since it
felt a bit "wrong" to use the bullet-proof glass block I've added
another recipe to create broken glass inside the forge. Additionally
you will need one acid bottle to make for more scarcity. The solar
panel itself is crafted with regular materials (e.g. forged steel
etc.) and steel- and robotics tools in order to increase scarcity.
